This is a simple script to checking that code follows the Moodle coding 
guidelines.

It was originally written by sam marshall of the Open University, and 
was later improved by several other OU developers.

At the moment the tool is very basic, but can easily be extended in 
future.

After you have installed this local plugin into Moodle in the usual way, 
you should see a new option Code checker under Site administration -> 
Development.

We hope you find this tool useful. Please feel free to enhance it.
